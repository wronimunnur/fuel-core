## Cheat Codes
 
To use cheat codes in FTL, you need to edit the game files. You can find the game folder in your GOG directory, usually C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\FTL Advanced Edition. Make a backup of the files before you edit them, in case something goes wrong.

One of the files you can edit is data.dat, which contains the game data. You can open it with a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. Inside the file, you can find various subfolders with different aspects of the game, such as blueprints, events, weapons, etc. You can edit these files with a text editor like Notepad++ to change the values of different items and events.
 
For example, if you want to increase the amount of scrap (the game currency) you start with, you can edit the file data\blueprints\autoBlueprints.xml.append and find the line `<shipBlueprint name="PLAYER_SHIP_HARD" layout="playerShipHard" ...>`. Under this line, you can find a tag that says `<initialResources>`. Inside this tag, you can change the value of `<scrap>` to whatever amount you want.
 
Another file you can edit is profile.sav, which contains your save data. You can find it in your Documents folder under My Games\FasterThanLight. You can open it with a text editor and change various values of your profile, such as achievements, unlocked ships, stats, etc.
 
For example, if you want to unlock all the ships and layouts, you can edit the line `<shipUnlocks>` and change all the values of `<ship>` and `<layout>` to "true".
 
Be careful when editing these files, as they may affect the game balance and stability. Always make a backup before making any changes.

## Trainers
 
If you don't want to mess with the game files, you can use trainers instead. Trainers are programs that run in the background and modify the game memory to give you various advantages. You can download trainers from various websites, such as Cheat Happens[^2^] or Hooked Gamers[^3^]. Make sure you download the trainer that matches your game version and platform.
 
To use a trainer, you need to launch it before or after launching the game. Then, you can activate different options by pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard. For example, some of the options that trainers offer are:
 
- Infinite crew health: Your crew members will not die or take damage.
- Infinite hull: Your ship will not take damage or explode.
- Unlimited missiles: You will not run out of missiles for your weapons.
- Unlimited drones: You will not run out of drone parts for your drones.
- Infinite charge: Your weapons and systems will charge instantly.
- Unlimited fuel: You will not run out of fuel for your jumps.
- Unlimited scrap: You will have infinite money to buy upgrades and items.
- Infinite oxygen: Your ship will not lose oxygen or suffocate your crew.
- Max skill EXP for selected character: The crew member that you select will have maximum skills in everything.
- Add scrap/fuel/missiles/drone parts: You can add more resources to your inventory by pressing a key.

Using trainers may make the game too easy or boring, so use them at your own risk. Also, some trainers may contain viruses or malware, so scan them with an antivirus before using them.
