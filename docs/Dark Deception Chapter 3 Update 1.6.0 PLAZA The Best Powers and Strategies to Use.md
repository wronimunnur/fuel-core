The game is inspired by classic horror games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil, as well as arcade games such as Pac-Man and Frogger.
 
The game features a first-person perspective and a dark and twisted storyline. The player controls a character who is trapped in a mysterious hotel by a mysterious woman named Bierce. She offers the player a chance to escape by collecting soul shards from various nightmares. However, the player is not alone in these nightmares, as they are hunted by terrifying creatures that can kill them in an instant.
 
The game has received positive reviews from critics and players alike, who praised its originality, atmosphere, gameplay, and sound design.

The game is currently available on Steam for Windows PC and Mac OS. The developers have also announced plans to release the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and VR platforms in the future. The game is expected to have five chapters in total, with Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 coming soon.
  
Dark Deception Chapter 3 introduces two new nightmares for the player to face: Dread Duckies and GremClowns. Dread Duckies are giant, evil ducks that roam around a dark carnival.

They can teleport and throw bombs at the player, as well as summon other clowns to join them.
