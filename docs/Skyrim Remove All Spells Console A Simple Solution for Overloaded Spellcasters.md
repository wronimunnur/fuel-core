# How to Remove All Spells in Skyrim with Console Commands
 
If you are playing Skyrim on PC, you might want to use console commands to remove all spells from your character. This can be useful if you want to start fresh with a new build, or if you have too many spells cluttering your inventory. In this article, we will show you how to remove all spells in Skyrim with console commands.
 
## What are Console Commands?
 
Console commands are special commands that you can type in the game's console to perform various actions. You can access the console by pressing the tilde key (~) on your keyboard. The console will appear as a window at the top of the screen, where you can type in commands and press enter to execute them. You can also use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through previous commands.

## How to Remove All Spells in Skyrim with Console Commands
 
To remove all spells in Skyrim with console commands, you need to use the `player.removespell` command. This command will remove a specific spell from your character, based on its ID. You can find the ID of any spell by using the `help` command. For example, if you want to find the ID of the Fireball spell, you can type `help fireball` in the console and look for the ID under "Spell".
 
To remove all spells in Skyrim with console commands, you need to repeat the `player.removespell` command for every spell that you have. This can be tedious and time-consuming, so you might want to use a shortcut. You can use the `bat` command to run a batch file that contains multiple commands. A batch file is a text file that has a .txt extension and is stored in your Skyrim folder. You can create a batch file with any text editor, such as Notepad.
 
To create a batch file that will remove all spells in Skyrim with console commands, you need to write one line for each spell that you want to remove, using the `player.removespell` command and the spell ID. For example, if you want to remove Fireball and Healing, you can write:
 `
player.removespell 12f70
player.removespell 12fcc
` 
You can name your batch file anything you want, as long as it has a .txt extension. For example, you can name it "removespells.txt". Save your batch file in your Skyrim folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim.
 
To run your batch file in the game, you need to type `bat` followed by the name of your batch file in the console. For example, if you named your batch file "removespells.txt", you can type `bat removespells` in the console and press enter. This will execute all the commands in your batch file and remove all the spells that you specified.
