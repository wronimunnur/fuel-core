## Farming Simulator 19: How to Master the Game
 
Farming Simulator 19 is not a game that you can just jump into and expect to succeed. It requires a lot of planning, strategy, and knowledge of the various aspects of farming. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you master the game and become a successful farmer.
 
### Choose the Right Difficulty Level
 
Farming Simulator 19 offers three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard. Each one has different starting conditions, prices, loan limits, and crop yields. Depending on your experience and preference, you can choose the one that suits you best. Easy mode is recommended for beginners who want to learn the basics of the game without too much pressure. Normal mode is for intermediate players who want a balanced challenge and realistic gameplay. Hard mode is for expert players who want to test their skills and face the harsh realities of farming.
 
### Use Workers and Helpers
 
One of the most useful features of Farming Simulator 19 is the ability to hire workers and helpers to perform various tasks for you. Workers can drive vehicles and operate machines, such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, spraying, etc. Helpers can transport goods, sell products, buy supplies, etc. To hire a worker or a helper, you need to enter the vehicle or machine that you want them to use and press the corresponding button. You can also assign them to specific fields or destinations using the map. Workers and helpers will cost you money per hour, but they will save you a lot of time and effort.

### Take Care of Your Animals
 
Farming Simulator 19 allows you to breed and care for five types of animals: cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, and horses. Each animal has its own needs and benefits. Cows produce milk, pigs produce manure and slurry, sheep produce wool, chickens produce eggs, and horses can be ridden and trained. To take care of your animals, you need to provide them with food, water, straw, grass, hay, silage, etc. You also need to clean their pens regularly and transport their products to the market. Taking care of your animals will reward you with income and fertilizer.
 
### Expand Your Farm
 
Farming Simulator 19 gives you the opportunity to expand your farm by buying new plots of land, buildings, vehicles, machines, tools, etc. You can also sell your old or unused equipment to free up some cash. Expanding your farm will allow you to grow more crops, breed more animals, diversify your products, and increase your profits. However, expanding your farm also comes with more costs and responsibilities. You need to manage your finances wisely and plan ahead for your investments.
