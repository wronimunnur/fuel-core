# The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn - A Review of the PC Game
 
The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is a video game based on the 2011 animated film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson. The game was developed by Ubisoft and released for various platforms, including PC, in October 2011. The game follows the adventures of Tintin, a young reporter, and his friends Captain Haddock and Snowy, as they search for a sunken ship that belonged to Haddock's ancestor.
 
The game features a variety of gameplay modes, such as platforming, puzzle-solving, sword fighting, plane piloting, and stealth. The game also allows players to switch between different characters, each with their own abilities and skills. For example, Tintin can use his binoculars to spot clues, Haddock can use his strength to break obstacles, and Snowy can sniff out hidden items. The game also has a co-op mode, where two players can work together to complete levels.

The game received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some praised the game's graphics, voice acting, and faithful adaptation of the film and the original comics by HergÃ©. Others criticized the game's short length, repetitive gameplay, lack of challenge, and technical issues. The game was also compared unfavorably to other adventure games, such as Uncharted and Tomb Raider.

The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is not the only game based on the Tintin franchise. There have been several other games released over the years, such as Tintin in Tibet, Tintin on the Moon, and Tintin: Destination Adventure. However, none of these games have received much acclaim or popularity, and most of them are considered to be mediocre or poor adaptations of the comics.
 
One of the reasons why Tintin games have not been very successful is that they face a difficult challenge of capturing the essence and charm of the original source material. The comics by HergÃ© are widely regarded as classics of the medium, with their distinctive style, humor, and adventure. The comics also have a loyal and passionate fan base, who have high expectations and standards for any adaptation. Therefore, any game that tries to recreate the comics has to balance between being faithful and being innovative, while also appealing to a wide audience.
 
Another reason why Tintin games have not been very successful is that they have to compete with other adventure games in the market, which often offer more depth, variety, and quality. For example, the Uncharted series by Naughty Dog is widely praised for its cinematic storytelling, thrilling action, and charismatic characters. The Tomb Raider series by Crystal Dynamics is also acclaimed for its immersive exploration, challenging puzzles, and dynamic combat. Compared to these games, Tintin games may seem simplistic, outdated, or boring.
